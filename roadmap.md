IOS:

Below is one way you might structure your vanilla Swift iOS app. This layout groups files by function (models, views, controllers, networking, helpers, etc.) and mirrors your backend’s functionality into separate service classes that map to your REST endpoints. Of course, this is just one example—you can adjust the details to your needs.

**A Few Key Points About This Layout**

1. **App & Configuration Files**  
   - **AppDelegate.swift / SceneDelegate.swift:** Standard entry points for your iOS app.
   - **Constants/APIConstants.swift:** Keep all your base URLs and endpoint path segments here. This makes it easy to update or change endpoints without combing through your code.

2. **Models**  
   - Define each object that your app will work with. For example, the `Car` model might have properties such as the car’s make, model, scanned date, and any metadata.  
   - Similarly, separate models for friend requests, trades, and feed items keep your data structured.

3. **Views & Custom Cells**  
   - Since you’re not using a design pattern like MVVM, your view controllers might instantiate and manage views directly.  
   - Custom table/collection view cells (in the Cells folder) can be used to display car cards, feed items, and friend requests.

4. **Controllers**  
   - **Auth Controllers:** `LoginViewController` and `RegisterViewController` handle authentication flows corresponding to POST /login and POST /register.
   - **Main Controllers:** Each major feature (feed, car collection, scanning, friend requests, trades) gets its own view controller.  
     For example, `ScanViewController` will interact with `CarService` to call POST /scan when a user scans a car.
   - **Navigation Controller:** If you’re using tab bars or navigation controllers, consider a dedicated controller (like `TabBarController.swift`) to manage transitions.

5. **Networking Services**  
   - The `APIClient` serves as a generic HTTP client that you can use to perform REST calls.
   - Break down the networking layer into feature-specific service classes. This helps keep your networking code modular.  
     For instance, `AuthService` handles login, logout, and refresh endpoints, while `FriendService` deals with friend-related endpoints.
   - Each service will encode and decode JSON to and from the models defined in your Models folder.

6. **Helpers**  
   - Utility files like `AuthenticationManager.swift` help manage login tokens or session state.
   - Extensions and UI helper functions keep your code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) by providing reusable functionalities across your app.

7. **Resources**  
   - Store your assets, storyboards, or XIB files in the Resources folder. If you’re using a storyboard-based approach, this is where your UI layouts reside.

This structure aims to keep your code organized by separating concerns:  
- **Models** define your data,  
- **Controllers** handle the view logic and user interaction, and  
- **Networking** manages communication with your REST Go backend.

Each service in the Networking folder can directly map to one or more of your backend endpoints. For example:
- **AuthService** will cover:
  - `POST /register`
  - `POST /login`
  - `POST /logout`
  - `POST /refresh`
- **CarService** will handle:
  - `GET /user/cars`
  - `POST /scan`
- **FriendService** will manage:
  - `GET /user/friend-requests`
  - `POST /friends/request`
  - `POST /friends/respond`
- **TradeService** and **FeedService** will similarly align with their respective endpoints.

This design will help keep your app scalable and maintainable as you add more features. Happy coding!

Here's a rough roadmap outlining the steps and order you might follow when developing your iOS front end:

---

### 1. **Planning & Requirements**
- **Feature Breakdown:** List out all features (e.g., authentication, scanning, car collection, friend requests, trading, feed).
- **Wireframes & Flowcharts:** Sketch the basic UI layouts and user flows. Identify key screens such as Login/Register, Car Collection, Scan, Feed, and Trade.
- **Technical Design:** Decide on the architecture (in this case, vanilla Swift) and design your API interactions (mapping endpoints to service classes).

---

### 2. **Project Setup**
- **Xcode Project Creation:** Set up a new Xcode project.
- **File Structure:** Implement the file layout discussed earlier (separate folders for Models, Views, Controllers, Networking, Helpers, and Resources).
- **Environment Setup:** Configure base URLs, API keys, and any third-party libraries if needed.

---

### 3. **Develop the Networking Layer**
- **API Client:** Build a generic API client using URLSession that can handle GET/POST requests, JSON encoding/decoding, and error handling.
- **Service Classes:** 
  - **AuthService:** Handle endpoints for login, registration, logout, and token refresh.
  - **CarService:** Implement methods for fetching the car collection and submitting scan data.
  - **FriendService & TradeService:** Build methods for sending/receiving friend requests and trade operations.
  - **FeedService:** Create a service for fetching feed data.
- **Error Handling & Testing:** Ensure that your networking layer can handle API errors gracefully and test these components with mock data or a staging environment.

---

### 4. **Implement Authentication Flow**
- **UI Screens:** Develop `LoginViewController` and `RegisterViewController` with appropriate UI elements.
- **Session Management:** Implement an `AuthenticationManager` to store and manage tokens (possibly using Keychain).
- **Integration:** Connect the UI to your `AuthService` and handle login/register API responses.
- **Testing:** Validate user authentication flows, token handling, and error messages.

---

### 5. **Build Core Features**
- **Car Collection:**
  - **Screen:** Develop `CarCollectionViewController` to display the user's cars.
  - **Integration:** Use `CarService` to fetch and display data.
- **Scanning Feature:**
  - **UI:** Create `ScanViewController` where users can trigger a scan.
  - **Backend Connection:** Integrate with the `POST /scan` endpoint.
- **Feed:**
  - **Screen:** Build `FeedViewController` to show a live feed of scans and trades.
  - **Networking:** Fetch feed data using the `FeedService`.
- **Friend Requests & Trading:**
  - **Friend Management:** Create a view for pending friend requests (`FriendRequestsViewController`) and integrate with `FriendService`.
  - **Trade Handling:** Develop views for initiating a trade (`TradeViewController`) and responding to trades (`TradeResponseViewController`), integrating with `TradeService`.

---

### 6. **Integrate & Polish**
- **UI Feedback:** Add loading indicators, error messages, and success alerts throughout the app.
- **Navigation:** Implement a navigation system (e.g., a TabBarController) to manage transitions between major screens.
- **Refinement:** Polish your UI components (custom cells, transitions, animations) to enhance the user experience.
- **Local Data Caching:** Consider caching responses locally to improve performance and reduce network calls.

---

### 7. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for your service classes and any critical business logic.
- **UI Tests:** Implement UI tests to simulate user interaction and validate flows.
- **Beta Testing:** Distribute a beta version (using TestFlight, for instance) to gather feedback and identify issues.

---

### 8. **Final Adjustments & Launch**
- **Bug Fixes & Optimizations:** Address any discovered issues from testing phases.
- **Performance Improvements:** Optimize network calls and UI performance.
- **App Store Preparation:** Finalize metadata, screenshots, and submit the app for review.

---

### 9. **Post-Launch**
- **Monitoring:** Use analytics and crash reporting tools to monitor app performance.
- **Updates:** Plan for iterative updates based on user feedback and backend changes.

This roadmap is iterative—you may find yourself revisiting earlier steps as new requirements emerge or during testing. By breaking down the development process into these phases, you'll have a clear path from planning through to launch. Happy coding!
